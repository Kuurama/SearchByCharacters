# SearchByCharacters
A different map searching approach for beat saber.
This mod is a fork of SearchFixes from rithik-b : https://github.com/rithik-b/SearchFixes (all credit belong to him)
This mod load before SearchFixes because both mods can't work with each others, it would also mean you want SearchByCharacters specificities,
which makes the research really less strict than SearchFixes.

**Features:**

Basic Search Fixes Features :
- Search by characters on Song, Artist, Subname or Mapper name
- Search terms can be in any order and from any of those 4 categories
- Search terms are matched using "and" instead of "or" (So saying "Night Raid" will show maps that have both words, "night" and "raid"

Specific SearchByCharacters added/edited Features :
- (convert special characters to allow maps containing them to be researched)
- Allow to search incomplete Map Name or Artist, for example : "gel arpeg" could show the map named "Flugel Arpegio"
This feature still have a counterpart => It's harder to find specific maps which are only made from like 3 letters because it will show up all the maps with those letter combination.
>As a result, no more issue finding really weird map name, or even maps you couldn't ever find with SearchFixes, but makes a bit harder finding maps with small name (if you have a lot of maps).
